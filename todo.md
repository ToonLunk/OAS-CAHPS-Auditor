# TODO

## High Priority
- Fix the bug where if there are more than 2 columns next to each other in the FRAME inel (like if you have to make a temporary column or something), the program doesn't read the columns correctly and thinks there are zero FRAME inel rows.

## Low Priority
- Add a GUI using Tkinter or PyQt

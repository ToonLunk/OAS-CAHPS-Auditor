                         OAS CAHPS AUDITOR
================================================================================

INSTALLATION:

  1. Find deploy.bat in this folder
  2. Right-click it and choose "Run as administrator"
  3. When prompted, choose "Y" to install context menu (recommended!)
  4. Wait for it to finish (takes a few seconds)
  5. Close this window and open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell
  6. Test it by typing: audit --help

================================================================================

HOW TO USE:

EASIEST WAY (If you installed context menu):
  1. Open File Explorer and go to the folder with your OAS Excel files
  2. Right-click on empty space inside the folder:
     - Windows 10: Right-click
     - Windows 11: SHIFT + Right-click (opens extended menu)
     - Windows 11 (Alternative): Right click, then click "Show more options"
  3. Click "Audit All OAS Files"
  4. Done! The audit runs automatically.

COMMAND LINE WAY:
Go to the folder with your Excel files, then right-click inside the folder, 
choose "Open in Terminal", and run one of these commands:

  audit filename.xlsx      Check a single file
  audit --all              Check all Excel files in the folder

The tool creates a report showing any issues it found. Reports are saved in
a folder called "audits". Files that couldn't be checked go in 
"audits/unable_to_audit".

================================================================================

IF DEPLOY.BAT DOESN'T WORK:

You can install manually:

  1. Put audit.exe somewhere permanent (like C:\Tools)
  2. Search Windows for "Environment Variables"
  3. Click "Edit the system environment variables"
  4. Click "Environment Variables"
  5. Find "Path" and click "Edit"
  6. Click "New" and type your folder path (e.g., C:\Tools)
  7. Click OK on everything
  8. Close and reopen your terminal

================================================================================

COMMON ISSUES:

  "Windows protected your PC" message:
    This is normal. Click "More info" then "Run anyway".

  Antivirus blocks audit.exe:
    The file is safe. Add it as an exception in your antivirus

  "audit" command not found:
    You need to restart your terminal after installing. If that doesn't help,
    check that the folder with audit.exe is in your system PATH variable.

  Don't see "Audit All OAS Files" when right-clicking:
    - Windows 11: Make sure you're holding SHIFT while right-clicking!
      (Windows 11 hides this in the extended menu)
    - Windows 10: Should appear with regular right-click
    - If still missing: You might have skipped context menu installation.
      Run scripts\register_context_menu.ps1 as administrator to add it.

  Want to remove the context menu:
    Run scripts\unregister_context_menu.ps1 as administrator. 

  If the program still doesn't work after trying these steps, please contact
  support (Tyler Brock) for help.
